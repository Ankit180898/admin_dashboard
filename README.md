  This dashboard is designed to provide comprehensive insights into the activities a user does, including nutrition and blood sugar level reports.

  It's perfect for keeping track of various activities and their impact on health and well-being.

  Bar Graphs: Visualize data comparisons using bar graphs for easy interpretation.
  Pie Charts: Display percentage distributions of different activities with pie charts.
  Scheduling Option: Set reminders for upcoming activities to stay organized and on track.
